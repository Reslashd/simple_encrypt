# simple_encrypt

A simple practice program to encrypt en decrypt a text file by adding(encrypting) or decreasing (decrypting) each read char by one.
Encrypted files contain the signature S_ENCRYPT23 on the last line so we can check if a file is encrypted or not.

See [wiki](wiki) for received feedback on the first version of the program.
